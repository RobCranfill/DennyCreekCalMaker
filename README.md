# DennyCreekCalMaker

This little python program will read a yearly schedule, as created by Ron R,
in CSV format exported from Excel, and create an ICS file, suitable for importing
into a calendar program of some sort.

You will want to run this like

`$ ./dccc.py DCC-in1.csv >DCC-out1.ics`
